What is EF Core?

Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight and extensible version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

EF Core is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.
Database Providers

The source for SQL Server, SQLite, and InMemory providers are included in this project. Additional providers are available. For a complete list, see https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/.
How do I use EF

If you want to use an officially supported Entity Framework release to develop your applications then head to https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/ef6/ where you can find installation information, documentation, tutorials, samples, and videos.

If you want to try out the latest changes that have not been officially released yet, you can choose to build the code. We regularily also make nightly builds of the Entity Framework codebase available.
